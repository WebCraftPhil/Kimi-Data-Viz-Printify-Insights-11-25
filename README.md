## 📖 Project Overview
This project transforms raw PDF sales exports from a Printify print-on-demand business into a dynamic, responsive web application. It serves as a case study in **rapid data visualization** and **automated business intelligence**.

Instead of static spreadsheets, this dashboard provides interactive insights into:
* **Revenue Trends:** Weekly tracking with 4-week moving averages to smooth volatility.
* **Seasonality:** Identification of key sales windows (specifically the Q2 Spring peak).
* **Product Performance:** Breakdown of top-performing SKUs (T-Shirts & Hoodies).
* **Growth Trajectory:** Cumulative revenue analysis over the 2025 fiscal period.

## 💡 The "AI-First" Workflow
This dashboard represents a shift in modern data engineering. It was architected and coded using **Open Source Consumer AI (KimiV2)** to accelerate the "Raw Data → Insight" pipeline.

* **Input:** Raw unstructured data (PDF/CSV) representing 43 weeks of operations.
* **Processing:** AI-driven data cleaning, structuring, and HTML/CSS generation.
* **Output:** A fully deployed, client-side application using Plotly.js.

## 🗝️ Key Features
* **Interactive Visualizations:** Zoom, pan, and hover over data points for granular details.
* **Editorial Design System:** Custom CSS using a "Terracotta & Sage" palette (`#c17b5c`, `#8a9a8b`) for professional presentation.
* **Responsive Layout:** Grid-based architecture that adapts to mobile and desktop screens.
* **Zero-Dependency Deployment:** Runs entirely in the browser; no backend server required.

## 📈 Business Insights Uncovered
* **Seasonal Peaks:** The data reveals a 35% revenue spike in Q2 (March–May), indicating a need for heavy inventory planning during early Spring.
* **Core Drivers:** T-Shirts and Hoodies account for 60% of total revenue.
* **Stability:** The 4-week moving average confirms a steady upward trajectory despite weekly volatility.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Visualization:** [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/)
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Variables)
* **Fonts:** Playfair Display (Headers), Inter (Body) - via Google Fonts
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
